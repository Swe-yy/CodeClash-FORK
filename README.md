## Project Board
We have the project board to keep track of the teams progress during the development process. It helps keep us on track and make the development progress efficient and transparent.

[GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/COS301-SE-2026/projects/33)

## Github Repo Structure
Our repo uses a monorepo structure. We have a main branch that contains the most recently working code. A dev branch branches off of main that contains the most recent developments in the project. Every other feature or hotfix gets branches off of and merged into dev before dev is merged into main, finally.

## Branching Strategy
This project uses the Git Flow branching strategy. 

Branches are named according to the features they implement or the issues they address, as well as the name of the team member working on the branch. 

Once a feature complete or an issue is addressed, branches are merged back into Dev. From there Dev is merged into main.

My technical focus lies in backend development and systems integration, where I enjoy building the reliable, well-structured foundations that power great software. I naturally gravitate toward leadership, and currently serve as team lead, keeping the team aligned, communication clear, and delivery on track. When I'm not coding, you'll find me gaming...or modding that game. |

Skilled in creating responsive, user-focused interfaces with strong attention to detail, visual consistency, and seamless user experiences. Experienced with JavaScript, PHP, Java, C++, Next.js, HTML/CSS, Figma, and Git. |
| <img src="docs/assets/team/Morgan%20Calaca.jpeg" width="100" height="100" style="object-fit:cover;border-radius:50%"> **Morgan Calaca** | Frontend and Integration Engineer [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-calaca-494b9a401) | I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of Pretoria with a keen inclination towards Mathematics and analytical problem solving, and finding ways of incorporating it into my Computer Science degree. I have also had a lifelong passion for gaming which was the entire basis of a years-long, budding interest in computers and coding before my degree that I never quite confronted until I was here. I believe the combination of these qualities culminates in me being a well-suited candidate for the CodeClash project as it fundamentally centers around gaming and mathematical concepts. This is further substantiated by the fact that it was my favourite and first choice due to its focuses being my passions. |

I enjoy learning new technologies and adapting to different environments to tackle complex problems. Beyond the technical side, I bring strong communication skills and a collaborative mindset, shaped by group projects and an entrepreneurship module that taught me to think practically about problem-solving and iterative development. |

This passion naturally bridged my love for mathematics and technology, leading me to specialize in FinTech and quantitative development. To achieve maximum computing power and system optimization, I have built proficiency in C++ and Python through practical applications, mastered Angular, Node.js, and TypeScript through networking modules, and adopted R within my mathematical statistics studies. |
