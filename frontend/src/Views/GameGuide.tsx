                        Every answer submitted is automatically compared against the correct solution using the game's validation system. Correct answers earn points, while incorrect answers receive no score. If multiple players answer correctly, the player who submits the correct solution in the shortest amount of time receives a higher score, rewarding quick thinking under pressure. This balanced scoring system ensures that success is determined not only by being fast, but also by writing accurate and correct solutions. At the end of each match, players can review their results, compare their performance, and identify areas for improvement before taking on their next challenge.
