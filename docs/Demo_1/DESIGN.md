# CodeClash — Design Specifications

This section defines the visual, structural, and interaction design decisions that guide the development of the CodeClash Gaming platform. It serves as a blueprint to ensure consistency across components and teams, particularly in a modular development environment. The design specifications translate system requirements into concrete interface and user experience guidelines, reducing ambiguity during implementation.

## 1. Brand Style

The brand style defines the visual identity of CodeClash and ensures a consistent, professional appearance across all interfaces. 

### Colour Palette

The following colours form the primary palette. All colours were selected with WCAG AA contrast compliance in mind.

| Role                        | Hex       |
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Primary text                | `#16213D` |
| Primary action (buttons)    | `#0E34A0` |
| Sidebar / header background | `#5F5980` |
| Page background             | `#D2D2D2` |
| Card background             | `#FFFFFF` |
| Win / positive ELO          | `#22C55E` |
| Lose / negative ELO         | `#EF4444` |

### Typography

| Typeface     | Role       | Weight          | Size Range |
|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Baloo Bhai 2 | Primary UI | 400 / 600 / 700 | 13–64 px   |

### Logo and Iconography

- The **CodeClash logo** is strategically displayed in main pages of the app such as:
    - Welcome
    - Sign Up
    - Sign In
    - Dashboard
- All icon and image imports reside in `src/assets/` and are referenced via static imports.

### Design Principles

- **Simplicity:** Pages present a single primary action per screen. Secondary actions are visually subordinate.
- **Hierarchy:** Bold weight and large size signal primary content; muted colours and smaller sizes indicate secondary information.
- **Responsiveness:** The design targets a **1440 × 1024 px** desktop viewport. 
- **Accessibility:** Colour contrast ratios meet WCAG AA. Interactive elements have visible focus states and descriptive ARIA labels.

### Accessibility

- **Colour contrast:** all body text on backgrounds meets WCAG AA (minimum 4.5:1).
- **Focus states:** all interactive elements receive a visible `drop-shadow` outline.
- **Semantic HTML:** headings use correct hierarchy (`h1 → h2 → h3`); buttons use `<button>`, not `<div>`.
- **ARIA labels:** icon-only buttons and decorative images carry `aria-hidden="true"` or descriptive `alt` text.
- **Form labels:** all inputs are associated with visible placeholder text and programmatic labels via `htmlFor`.

## 2. Wireframes

- The wireframes provide a representations of each key screen. They illustrate component placement, navigation flow, and interaction points. Annotations explain behaviour and design intent.
- **These wireframes can also be found as a figma file or pdf document in docs/wireframe.**

## Screen 1 — Welcome Page

The Welcome page is the first screen a user encounters upon launching the application. It serves as the entry point to the entire platform.

![Welcome](wireframe/Welcome_Wireframe.png)

**Component Placement:**
- The codeclash mascot is centred horizontally, occupying the upper portion of the screen. It sits atop the shield icon.
- The heading "Welcome to CodeClash Gaming" is positioned centrally below the logo in Baloo Bhai 2 Bold, 64 px, `#16213D`.
- The "Sign in" button (500 × 60 px, fill `#0E34A0`) is centred below the heading, serving as the dominant call to action.
- The "Are you a new user?" prompt and "Sign up" link are stacked below the button, in smaller text (24 px), with "Sign up" underlined to indicate it is a navigable link.

**Navigation Flow:**
- "Sign in" → navigates to the Sign In screen.
- "Sign up" → navigates to the Sign Up screen.

**User Interaction Points:**
- Single primary action (Sign In) reduces cognitive load for returning users.
- New user path is present but visually subordinate to avoid overwhelming first-time visitors.

## Screen 2 — Sign Up Page

The Sign Up page collects the information needed to create a new account.

![Signup](wireframe/Signup_Wireframe.png)

**Component Placement:**
- The "← Back" button (91 × 31 px, fill #5F5980) is anchored to the top-left at all times, providing a consistent escape route.
- The "Sign Up" heading (64 px, Baloo Bhai 2 Bold) is centred at the top of the form area.
- Four input fields (500 × 60 px each, white fill) are stacked vertically: First name, Last name, Email address, Password.
- The Terms & Conditions checkbox (31 × 31 px) and label sit below the password field, left-aligned to the form.
- The "Sign up" button (500 × 60 px, `#0E34A0`) is the primary action button.
- An "or" divider with two flanking lines (218 px each) separates the primary action from the social login options.
- "Sign up with Google" (`#FFFFFF`) and "Sign up with Apple" (`#16213D`) buttons (500 × 60 px each) are stacked below the divider, each carrying their respective provider icon at 28 × 28 px.

**Navigation Flow:**
- "← Back" → navigates to the Welcome screen.

**User Interaction Points:**
- All four fields must be completed and the Terms & Conditions checkbox must be ticked before the form can be submitted.
- Google and Apple sign-up buttons are OAuth entry points, reserved for a future backend integration. They are wired to placeholder callbacks (`onGoogleSignUp`, `onAppleSignUp`).

## Screen 3 — Sign In (Login) Page

The Sign In page allows existing users to authenticate and access their account.

![Signin](wireframe/Signin_WIreframe.png)

- Two input fields (500 × 60 px): Email address and Password, stacked vertically.
- The "Sign in" button (500 × 60 px, `#0E34A0`, 2 px border) is the primary action.
- The "or" divider and social buttons follow the same layout as the Sign Up screen.
- "Are you a new user?" and "Sign up" link are positioned at the bottom of the form, offering a redirect for users who arrived at this screen by mistake.

**Navigation Flow:**
- "← Back" → navigates to the Welcome screen.
- "Sign up" link → navigates to the Sign Up screen.
- Successful sign-in → navigates to the Dashboard.

**User Interaction Points:**
- The "Welcome back!" sub-heading provides positive reinforcement for returning users.
- The "Are you a new user?" prompt at the bottom ensures users who reach this screen by mistake can self-correct without using the Back button.
