## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the software requirements for **CodeClash**, a competitive 1v1 gaming platform where players solve mathematics and programming problems in real time. It is intended for developers, designers, and stakeholders involved in the design, development, and testing of the platform.

### 1.2 Scope
CodeClash enables registered users to compete in ranked and casual matches across two game modes: **Math Battles** and **Programming Battles**. The platform includes matchmaking, real-time gameplay, ELO-based ranking, an achievement system, player reporting, and a management interface for content and moderation.

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| ELO | Numerical skill rating updated after each ranked match (standard Elo formula, K=32, starting value 600) |
| Ranked Match | A competitive match that affects both players' ELO ratings |
| Casual Match | A non-competitive match between friends; ELO is unaffected |
| Manager | An authorised user with administrative privileges over content and player management |
| Player | An authenticated registered user participating in games |
| Judge0 | Third-party code execution engine used to evaluate programming submissions |
| Sandbox | Isolated execution environment that prevents user code from affecting the host system |

#### Definition of Done

DOD is PR made, reviewed and the issue is moved to done in the project board

## 6. Architectural Requirements

### 6.1 Quality Requirements

#### Performance
- Initial application shell loads within **3 seconds** on a standard broadband connection.
- Matchmaking pairs users within **30 seconds** under normal load.
- Code execution results are returned within **10 seconds** for standard submissions.
- The system supports at least **100 concurrent active matches** without response time degradation.
- All user actions receive visual feedback within **200 ms**.

#### Reliability
- WebSocket disconnections are handled gracefully; match state is preserved for a reconnecting user for at least **60 seconds**.
- A failure in the code execution service shall not crash or affect the primary backend.
- System uptime shall be at least **99%** during active usage periods.
- All errors and exceptions are logged for debugging and monitoring.

#### Security
- Passwords are stored as salted hashes via AWS Cognito.
- All data in transit is encrypted using TLS (HTTPS).
- JWT tokens expire after a defined period and require refresh.
- User-submitted code only executes inside an isolated sandbox with CPU caps, memory quotas, and no network access.
- All API endpoints enforce authentication and authorisation checks.
- Authentication endpoints implement rate limiting against brute-force attacks.

#### Scalability
- The matchmaking service is designed to scale horizontally.
- The code execution service is decoupled from the primary backend to allow independent scaling.
- The database accommodates a growing user base and match history without structural changes.

#### Usability
- The application is fully functional on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Error messages are clear, specific, and actionable.
- The code editor provides syntax highlighting and auto-indentation for all supported languages.
- The interface targets a **1440×1024 px** desktop viewport; the programming battle is optimised for desktop.
- WCAG AA colour contrast compliance throughout.

#### Maintainability
- Consistent coding standards enforced by ESLint.
- Core business logic has a minimum of **80% unit test coverage**.
- Changes to one service do not require changes to others.
- All environment-specific configuration is managed through environment variables; nothing is hardcoded.

#### Auditability
- Logs are maintained for all match outcomes, ELO changes, and user reports.
- Anti-cheat flags are logged with timestamps and associated user identifiers.

---

### 6.2 Architectural Patterns

| Pattern | Application in CodeClash |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Modular Monolith / Layered Architecture** | The backend separates concerns into route, controller, service, and data-access layers; each feature domain (users, matches, problems, etc.) is a self-contained module |
| **Decoupled Execution Service** | The code execution engine (Judge0) runs as a separate service, contacted over HTTP; a failure there does not affect the core backend |
| **Real-Time Event-Driven (WebSocket)** | Match state, timers, and opponent progress are pushed over a persistent WebSocket connection rather than polled via REST |
| **Queue-Based Matchmaking** | Players are placed in an in-memory queue and matched when a compatible opponent is found; the queue is drained asynchronously |
| **Client-Side SPA** | The React frontend is a single-page application; navigation between screens does not trigger full-page reloads |

---

### 6.3 Design Patterns

| Pattern | Where Applied |
|---------|--------------|
| **Strategy Pattern** | ELO calculation and answer validation vary by game mode; each mode encapsulates its own strategy |
| **Observer / Event Emitter** | Achievement unlocking listens for match completion events without coupling to the match service directly |
| **Factory Pattern** | Problem creation selects between a `MathProblem` or `ProgrammingProblem` concrete type based on the `type` field |


---

### 6.4 Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|------------|--------|
| **Desktop-first** | The programming battle UI is designed and tested for desktop viewports (1440×1024 px minimum); mobile is out of scope for the current version |
| **Two-player only** | Each match links exactly two players; multiplayer lobbies are not supported |
| **Ranked ELO is immutable by players** | Only Managers may manually adjust ELO; automated updates happen only at match conclusion |
| **Code execution isolation** | User code must never execute outside of the Judge0 sandbox; direct server-side execution is prohibited |
| **Branch discipline** | The `main` branch must always reflect a deployable, working version of the system |
| **No hardcoded secrets** | All environment-specific configuration must use environment variables |
| **OAuth scope** | Google and Apple sign-in are wired as future placeholders; not in scope for the current release |

---

## 7. Technology Requirements

### 7.1 Frontend
| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Framework | React (SPA) |
| Styling | CSS with design tokens defined in `DESIGN.md` and also making use of Tailwind CSS|
| Real-time | WebSocket client |
| Code editor | Embedded code editor component with syntax highlighting and auto-indentation |
| Math input | Custom mathematical input keyboard component |
| Browser support | Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions) |

### 7.2 Backend
| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Framework | Express |
| Authentication | AWS Cognito (salted hashes, JWT bearer tokens) |
| Real-time | WebSocket server |
| API style | REST, JSON, `application/json` |

### 7.3 Code Execution
| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Execution engine | Judge0 (external service) |
| Isolation | Sandboxed container with CPU time limits, memory quotas, no network access |
| Test environment | Mock Judge0 implementation for unit and integration testing |

### 7.4 Data
| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Database | Relational database (schema defined in `architecture_diagram.png`) |
| Data format | UUID primary keys; JSON over REST |

### 7.5 DevOps & Tooling
| Concern | Technology |
|---------|-----------|
| Containerisation | Docker |
| Local environment | `docker-compose up` (single command deployment) |
| Cloud deployment | Publicly accessible cloud environment (deployed before each demo) |
| Linting | ESLint |
| Testing | Vitest (unit + integration); 80% minimum coverage on core business logic |
| Edge case testing | Infinite loops, memory overflows, malformed and malicious input covered by test suite |
